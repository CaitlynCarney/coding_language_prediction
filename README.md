### Description
- Using web-scraping techniques scrape githubs doctor who repositories to take the text from the readme files and the primary coding language; to build a data set. Then transform the new dataset into a form that can be used in a natural language processing machine learning model (NLP)., and choosing the best one for predicting the coding language based on the text from readme files.

### Goals
- Create a NLP model to predict the programming language used in a github repository based on the words and word combinations found in the readme files.
    
### Where did you get the data?
- Web scrapping github with the search term "Doctor Who"

### Projet Outline:
    
- Acquisiton of data
    - Search for Doctor who repos on git hub
    - Web scrape to gather data
- Prepare and clean data with python - Jupyter Labs
    - Drop nulls
    - Make all text lowercase
    - Tokenize the data
    - Stem/Lemmatize
    - Remove stopwords
- Explore data:
    - How often are words used?
        - Count
        - Percentage
    - Check out word clouds for top 4 languages
        - Is ther anything that stands out?
    - Check out bar graphs using bigrams for top 4 languages
        - Is there anything of importance?
    - Check out word clouds using bigrams for top 4 languages
        - What di you notice?
- Modeling:
    - Make multiple models.
    - Pick best model.
    - Test Data.
    - Conclude results.
